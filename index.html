        <p>The biggest challenge was to construct a layout for a tic tac toe grid and control panel that would make good use of available space on a wide variety of screen sizes. I used a combination of absolute and relative position, along with viewport-based sizing. The result may skew at abnormally wide or narrow screens, but should work correctly on most screens I had a chance to test.</p>
        <p>I spent several hours on this, and focused most of my effort on selecting the right layout approach, rather than adding a lot of sophistication or modularity into the code. The javascript implementation is simple and straightforward, with variable names that should help to explain what is going on.</p>
        <p>Another interesting decision I had to make was whether to implement the game board data structure with a multi-dimensional array. If there were any chance that this code would have to be adapted to a 4x4 or larger game board, I would have chosen a 2-dimensional array. With a fixed grid of 3x3 (which is a basic principle of Tic Tac Toe) it was more straightforward to use a 1-dimensional array of 9 elements to represent the 3x3 grid.</p>
